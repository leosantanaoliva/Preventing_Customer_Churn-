# Preventing Customer Churn in a Telecom Company
## Introduction
Customer retention is a key factor in the success of telecom companies, as acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. High churn rates can significantly impact revenue and brand reputation. By leveraging data analysis, predictive modeling, and visualization tools, companies can proactively address customer dissatisfaction and reduce churn.
## Problem
The telecom company observed a **consistent rise in customer churn** over recent quarters. Key drivers included dissatisfaction with service quality, billing issues, and lack of personalized offers. Without a clear understanding of why customers leave and how to intervene, the company risked further revenue loss and increased acquisition costs.
## Question
Based on the churned customers, what is the probability of the non-churned customers eventually churning?
